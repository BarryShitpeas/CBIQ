created to allow for the visualisation of DNA damage markers at specific
stages of the cell cycle on a dataset that examined >1,000 individual cells
per condition. 


### What can CBIQ do for you?
- 3 Varible scatter plot
- Jitter dot/bar plot
- Cell cycle gating
    - Quantification of marker expression in specific cell sub-populations
